# Self Organizing Maps


## SEE NOTES.MD FOR PROGRESS AND TO DO LIST
A custom self organizing map network for oceanographic purposes

- One of the key goals here is to keep weights in a state that directly represents the data without any transformations (i.e. a weight of a thermocline state reprepesents a real thermocline)
