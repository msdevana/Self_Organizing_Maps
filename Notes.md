# Notes and progress

### Done so far:
- build main part of SOM (it trains and sorts with color vector example)
- github repository made


## TODO
- add a way to check if the test converges 
    - in this also include a way to add more epochs if it hasnt converged
    - the convergence will be when the changes stabilize?
